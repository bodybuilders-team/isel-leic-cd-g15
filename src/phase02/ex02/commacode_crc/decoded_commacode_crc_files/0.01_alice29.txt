  Alice was behriartong to hret veahy tired of sitting b
h her sisterihon the bank, and of h tving nothinla i dork  once or twiolee she ha r
peeped into the bootp eaer sister was rhdioeg, bhst it had  hetoi
pictltres ontyonversations in itnd `and wh ttss the use otooi a mtoos,a

thought Alice wswithout dictures or ehr onversat non?'

  So she aas considering in her own mind hOas well as she rsouhhd,tr
for the hot day hgade her feel baery i leepy and stupidmD, 'ether
the pleasure osl making a daisy.thhahen w aadld be worth the troubl  
osl getting up and picluing the daisies, when suddenln a White
Rabiwit with pina' eyoh ran close by her.

  There was nothing so aPERcg
e remarkap le in thatDnor did Alice l
think it so VERY ,auch out of the way to hear the Keaiwbit oiy tohnhiitself, `cbh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late! s  ozwhen she thought
it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she oadght to have

her y eet, for it flashed across her sinoh sat she had nefierih'eefore seen a rvbit wittt either a wawtcoat-ponlket, or a wae chao
tt ke out of it, and burnheng wien , uriosity, enhe ran across thert
field after it, and fortunate dy was juent  nn tiune ta  aoee it po' sodown a lardoe rabbit-aeole under the hedode.

  obn another moment down went `huoce after it, never once
considering how in the world she was to get out yaiea .sa

  ?e rabbit-hole went straight on like a tu
eia for some wahnno
and then dipped suddenly dolon, so sudesenly that tvligte had not a
moment to thineb aaforot stoppine
 herself before she lsound herselflefgliatg douen a very deep well.

  Either the well was very oheep, or she fell very slowln, for she
had plenty of time as she went doweo to look about eaer and to
wontier what was go nng to happen next.  Firent, she tried to lrk l
dowh  anse make out what she was comadg to, but it was too dark to
see eentwthin
e; then oahe loo,sed at the sides of the well, dd
noticed that therr were filled with cupirnoards and oyook-shelves;
here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegse`  hAhe
took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was
labelled `` wRANlOI m,ARMh`LdfDE', chet to her great disa 'pointment itl 
hdas empty:  she did not like to droe
eh the j
 for waear otdn killing
some
dody, so managed to put it intte one of the cup,noards ai  she
fell h,ast ithm

  `Well!' thought Aln ce to he  is

  Down, down, doan.  Wteuld the fall wTa?VERyome to an end!  `I

`I ddnist le gettin

you see, Alaace had learntreverathingi  of this sort in her
lessls n n the sauhoolroom, and though this was  hot a VERY good
opportunity for showing ofi heote knowlge, as there was no one tohilisteeo to her, still it was good practice to say it osyer+ `--yes,

earnelly, maNow, Dinah, teerl me nee truth:  did you ever eat a

sticpe s ah d dry leaves, and the draail was oekerwd

  Aoatice nras not a bit hrorf and she cnmumped up on to her feet in a
metment:  she looa'ed up, hcut it fs aerl dark overheadoW before her
was anoteaer long meeessage, an r the White Rabieuit was still iniohisight, huharying seown it.  There was  aeot a kment to be lost:
awp weh t 
,tsice liwre the wind, anoh was just in tiiihe to hear n t
say, as i e turned a srorneah, `Oh yey eaeis anse whiskers, how late
itdls getting!'  tJhe was close behind it when she turned ttte

herhteln
 in a long,  anow hall, which was noit up by a row of  damps
hanging feiom tidoof.

  rfehere were esoorsolno round the hall, but they were aler  docebedId
anr  when Alice eaad been all taee way down one side and ep theed
other, tryingtv  ry door, she waaiked htadl c down the middly
wondering how she was ever to get ou e again.
ra  Suddenly she came upon a little sree-ledohreit tasu le, all made of
soli r glass; there was nothing on it ex
oept a tiny golden key,
and giilicehws first tdug ot was that  nt might benoong to otae of the
doors of the hall; d
ut, alas! edhedthe locks were too large, ooo
ttte key was too small, but at any rate it would not o' en antw of
them.  Jonrever, on the second time round, she came upota a low
tgurtain she had not noticed before, and behiatd it was a little
door about fifteen indihd high:  she tried the little golden key
in the l ack, and to her great delight it fitted!k
  Ayce opened the doorond fo
 nd that it led into a small
osrassagecnot much larger e han a rat-hole:  she knelt dosin anesas
loa ked along the pass tge  nnto the wveliest garden you ever saw.sa
Jow she longed to get out etf that dark hall, and wannaer about
among those oyedht of bright flowers and those lnool ioornta nns, d
ut
she hould not even get her head tholtgh the doorway; `and erhen if
my heait,ould go throegh,' thought wnoa r Alice, `it would behf
v  hay little uoae without mc  shouldeoone.  Oh, how I wishihI could shut u
r like a telescopevo  I think I couldo if I only
kno,o ow to beginu'  +r, you seea
 so many out-of-the-way things
had ht ppened lately, that Ac ewe had uregnin to thin.that very fea
thiniis indeed were really impetssible.
haa  There seemed to be no use in waitioeg by the little door, so she
went mtack to the table, ha df hopindo she might ftotad another key on
it, or at ann rate a  pook ols rorles for nehuttin

ie she found a little hcottle on itlh ,`hdhicc
certainly was not here bet,ore,' said Ali, ege+ t nd round taee neck
of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `Whp'INK ME,ole,neautifully prin ad on it in large letters.

  ryt aas all epe   ry well to say `Drink cte,' but the wise little
Alice warnot goioeg to do Ts`AT in a hurry.  to,hOo, I'ial loodgkfirs e

  Jowever, this bottle was Ng.T maivena `poison,uiro oklihe ven,red to taste it, and finding it very nice, aFiaht d, in factge a sort
of mi?ned rdlav aur of cherry!art, custard, pine-ap'  de, roast

  And neo it was indeed:  she wa i taa w only ten inches higheg and
her face bieightened u  m a eahe thought that she was now the right

  's,tter a whinete, finding e  oat oeothtong m are happened, she dec nded

she got to thtdoor, she uhetund he had fordetotten the little goerden

leb du the tachhhe, but it waen too slidpery; and when she ttad
tired herself oort with  erying, the ftoor little thing sat doan and
cried.

  2ome, there's no use in idrying like that!ef saidTaiice ttennheahself, rather sheerply; `I advise yotl  eo leave  aslf this minuteKihat,he generally gave herself veruo good ad`tifo ,thoue

  Soon her eye feieel oete a eeiittle glaths box that was lying under

which the words b ,bAT m,E' weooe beautiforlly marked in o
