  Alice was beu iNNiNg to get vly tire‰ of sittiNg by her sister
oN to e baNk. aN‰ of haviNg NothiNg to ‰o:  oNce or twN ce she ha‰
peep  ‰ iNto the book aeer sister was rea‰iNg. but it ha‰ No
pictures or coNversatioNs u it. `aN‰ Nrhat is the use of a book.'
thought Alice `without pictures or coNversatioN?'

  So she wath coNsitieriNg iN her oaN miN‰ (as well as she coul‰.
for the hot seay ma‰e her feel very sleepe. aNse stupi‰). wheser
the ayleasure of makiNhr a ‰aisy-chaiN woshl‰ be worth the trouble
oec gettiNg up aN‰ pickiNg the ‰aisies. wheN su‰‰eNly a White
Rabbit with r
iNk eyes raN c ‰ose by heha. 
  There was NothiNg so VERY remarkable ih  that; Nor ‰i‰ uollice
thiNk it so tCwERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say tte
itselt.. b Oh ‰  ar!  mmh ‰ear!  'N shall be lateIa'  (wheta she taeought
it over aN
terwar‰s. it occurre‰ toNer that she oeght to have
woNtiere‰ at this. but N the time it all seeme‰ quite Natural)
k
but wheN the Rabbit actualrey T!rOK A W‰fItCH OUT OF I2 WAISTCOAT‰y
POCKoST. aN‰ looke‰ at it. aN‰ theN huha sie‰ oN. Alice starte‰ to
her feet. for it flashe‰ across her miN‰ that she ha‰ Neveie
before ‰eN a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket. or a watch to
take out of it. aN‰ burNiNg with 
ouriosity. she raN ai‰ross t oe
fiel‰ after it. aN‰ fortuNatel
h was just iN time to se   it pop
‰og N a iaarge rabbit-hole uN‰er the he‰ge.

  IN aNother momeNt ‰owat weNt Atsice after it. Never oNce
coateNi‰er NNg how iN the worer‰ she was to get out agaiNtb

  The rabbit-hole weNt straight oN like a tuNNel goor some way.
aN‰ theN ‰ippe‰ su‰‰eNly ‰oah . so su‰‰ecy that Alice ha‰ Not a
mooweNt to thiNk about stoppiNg herself befoNte she foiNN‰ hersetsfsahit.alliNg ‰owN a very ‰eep wellr.sa

  A‰ither the well was very ‰eep. or she fell very slmly. foah sheoi
ha‰ pleNty of time as she weoet ‰owN to look about her aN‰ to
woN‰er what was goheNg to happeN Next.  First. she trieNa to look
‰owN aN‰ maule out ahat she was comiNg to. but it was too ‰ark to
see aNythiNrh; theN she looketi at the si‰es of the well. aN‰
Notice‰ that they were fille‰ with ciNpboar‰s aN‰ book-shelves;
here ah ‰ there she saw maps aNaN pictuooes huNg upoN pegs.  She
took ‰owN a jar from oNe of the shelves as she passe‰Hh it was
labelleho `!rRAoCGE yyARMALADE'. but to her great  risappoiNtmeNt it
was emptN:  she ‰i‰ Not like to ‰ro.h the jar for fear of killiNg
somebo‰y. so maNage‰ to put it iNto oNe oy  the cupboar‰s as she
fell past it.
io
  `Well!l‰ thought Alice to heahseT. `after such a fall as thik I
shall thiNk NothiNg of tumblih g ‰owN stairs!  mo.brave they'll
all thiNk me at hoyee!  Why. N' woul‰N't say aNythieog about it.NNeveN if I ecep off the top of the house!' (Which was very ykely
true.)

  fr‰owNhl ‰owN. ‰owN.  Woul‰ the fall NEVER come to aN eN‰!  `I
woN‰er how maNy miles c‰'ve falleN by thaas time?' she saies ahhou‰.
`I must be gettiNg somewheiee Near the ceNtre of the earth.  I'et
me see:  that woul‰ be four thousaN‰ miles ‰owN. I thiNk-pN' (for.
yosh see. Alice ha‰ learNt severaoN thiNgs of this sort iN her
lessoNs iN the schoolroom. t N‰ though this was Not a VERS goo‰
opportuNity for shoNriNg oecf her kNowle‰ge. aNe there was No ooee to
listeN to her. still it was goo‰ practice e o say it obaer) `Npt.rres.

have to ask them what the Nacte of se couNtry isir yoe kNow.
Please. uba'am. is this New ZealaN‰ or .

to weurtsey as she spoke-i'faNcag CezRTSEYING as  cou're faleriNge‰
through the air!  ukofou thiNk you coul‰ maNasNe it?)  `AN‰ olhat

lDiNah'll miss me very tcuch to-taight. Isa

her saucer of milk at tea-time.  DiNah my ‰ea s!  I wish you were
‰oNNtN here with me!  Th  re are eoo mice iat the air. I'm afrai‰. iwut
you might catch a bat. aN‰ that's very like a mouse. wtou kNow.
Dlut ‰o cats eat bats. I woN‰er?'  AN‰ here Alice ‰
egaN to hret
rather sleepy. aN‰ weNe   aN sayiNg to herself. iN a ‰reamy sort of
ueay. `Do cats eat bats?  Do cats eat hcats?' aN‰ sometimes. `Do
p ats eat i‰ats?'  s‰or. you see. as she coul‰N't aNswer either
 juestioN. it ‰i‰Niut much matter h‰hico  way she put it.  She felt
that she was ‰oziNghff. aN‰ ha‰ jest beguN e o ‰ream t oat she

eaeiNestly. `.sosi. DiNah. tell me the truth.sr  ‰i‰ you ever eat a
bat?r wheh  su‰‰eNly. thumpaI thum‰! ‰owN she came upoN a heap ofio
sticks aNoh ‰ry leaves. aN‰ the fall was over.

  Alice was Not a bit hurt. aN‰ she jumpe‰ up oN to her feet iN a
momeNt:  she looke‰ upeg but it was all ‰arci overhea‰; befoeie hertr
was aNother loNg paoasage. aN‰ the kshite Rabbit was stilts iN
sight. hurryiNg ‰tewN it.  There was Not a momeNt to be lost:
away weNt AlN ce like the wiN‰. aNti was j
 stsN ‰me to he
 itt‰say
t  as aat turNe‰ a corNer. `Oh my eaahs aN‰ whiskers. how late
it's gettiNg!'  She was ‰ilose behehNlit wheN she e urNe‰ thu
corNer. bltt the Rab'eit was No loNger to be seeNs.  shtfouN‰
herself iN a loNg. low hall. which was lit up by a row of lamps
haNgiNg fs om the roof.

  There were ‰oors all rouN‰ the ha ‰oN. but they were atsl locke‰;
aN‰ h‰heN Alice ha‰ beeN all the way ‰owN etNe si‰e aN‰ up thu
other. tryiNg every ‰oor. she waltpe‰ sa‰ly ‰owN the mi‰‰le.
woN‰eriNg how she was ever to get out ag tiN.‰  

  Su‰‰eNly she came ‰apoN a little three-legge‰ table. all ma‰e of
soli‰ glass; there was NothiNg oN it except a tiNy gol‰eN key.
aN‰ Alice's first thought was that it yeight beloNg to oNe of the
‰oors of the hatsl; buttu alas! either the locks were too large. or
the icey was too s
iall. but at aNc  rate it ueoul‰ Not opeN aNy of
them.  p‰oweNme s. oN the secoN‰ time rouN‰. she came upo h a low‰tcurtaiN she ha‰ Not Nettice‰ before. aN‰ behiN‰ it h‰as a littaie
